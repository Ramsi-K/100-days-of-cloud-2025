# Day 8/100

**Today’s Progress:**  
Focused on the EdgeMind AWS Hackathon. Realized I didn’t fully understand how AWS Bedrock, Lambda, and agent deployments actually work, so I deep-dived into enablement sessions, YouTube demos, and GitHub examples.

**Learned:**

- Core structure of MCP-based agent workflows through Strands notebooks and deployment samples.
- Difference between Lambda-chain orchestration and true multi-agent (“swarm”) setups.
- Troubleshooting AWS Diagram MCP on Windows, Docker, and finally WSL — success after JSON config fixes in VSCode.

**Reflection:**  
This redesign shifted EdgeMind from chained Lambdas to a real agent-driven architecture. Painful debugging day, but the system finally runs end-to-end.
