**Today’s Progress:**  
Completed the final week of the BeSA Cloud Academy — focused on modernization frameworks and services.

**Learned:**

- API Gateway {proxy+} for unified routing across methods.
- HTTP Proxy Integration for full request/response transparency.
- SNS Fan-Out and Message Filtering for scalable event-driven design.
- Architectural benefits of decoupled communication patterns.

**Reflection:**  
Earned the final badge and certificate!  
This program built a solid foundation in AWS modernization and migration workflows — highly recommend for anyone new to cloud architecture.
