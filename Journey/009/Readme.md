# Day 9/100

**Today’s Progress:**  
Completed the “Agentic AI for Healthcare & Life Sciences” workshop using Strands Agents and Bedrock AgentCore for multimodal biomarker analysis.

**Learned:**

- Hands-on experience with Strands agent orchestration in applied healthcare contexts.
- MEC-level orchestration patterns and telecom-side inferencing constraints from AWS Office Hours.
- Reviewed and refined Strands deployment documentation for the EdgeMind v2 cycle.

**Reflection:**  
Today clarified the architecture direction for EdgeMind. The shift from static Bedrock calls to distributed agent orchestration feels like the right step forward.
