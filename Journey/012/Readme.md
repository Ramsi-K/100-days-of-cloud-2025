# Day 12/100

## Cloud Research

Today, I started the **AWS Cloud Quest: Generative AI Practitioner** learning path.
The first module focused on understanding the _fundamentals_ of generative AI, including transformer architecture, encoder–decoder models, and fine-tuning workflows.

In the hands-on lab, I explored Amazon Bedrock by:

- Launching and navigating two Bedrock playgrounds.
- Testing model hyperparameters and enabling compare mode to evaluate text model outputs.
- Trying out image generation and comparing results across multiple models.

It was a heavy theory-plus-practice day, but it clarified how Bedrock integrates with foundation models to enable both chat-based AI and image generation workflows.
