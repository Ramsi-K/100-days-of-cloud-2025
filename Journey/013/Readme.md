# Day 13/100

## Cloud Research

Today's lab: _Generate Code for a Webpage._

- Used **Amazon Bedrock (Nova Lite)** to generate HTML templates for a marketing webpage.
- Connected to a pre-configured **EC2 instance** via **Systems Manager Session Manager** and updated two HTML files.
- No automation or CI/CD — focus was on showing how non-technical staff could leverage GenAI to refresh site content inside a managed AWS environment.
- Watched overview lectures on **Bedrock**, **Systems Manager**, **AI Monitoring Tools**, **When to Use AI**, and **AI Model Lifecycle**.
- Plan: finish remaining GenAI Practitioner modules this week, then switch to **AWS Developer Associate** prep (serverless path suits me better than SAA).
