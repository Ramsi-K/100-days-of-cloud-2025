# Day 11/100

**Today’s Progress:**  
Focused on studying AWS Wavelength, Azure Edge Zones, and Google Distributed Cloud for EdgeMind’s deployment model.

**Learned:**

- Comparative frameworks for edge inference orchestration.
- Core principles of low-latency regional compute for AI workloads.

**Reflection:**  
A theory-heavy day, but valuable. Bridged gaps between academic edge computing models and practical agent deployment strategies.
